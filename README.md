# SOC-Automation

## Objective
The SOC Automation project aimed to develop a comprehensive automation system for a Security Operations Center (SOC). The primary focus was on automating alert triage, incident response, and threat intelligence integration to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the SOC team. This project provided hands-on experience in utilizing various security tools and scripting to automate routine tasks and improve overall security posture.


### Skills Learned

-Proficiency in developing automation scripts using Python and PowerShell.
-Advanced knowledge of SOC workflows and processes.
-Expertise in integrating various security tools and platforms for automation.
-Improved understanding of incident response and threat intelligence operations.
-Enhanced ability to analyze and interpret security alerts and logs.
-Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

-Python: For scripting and automating SOC tasks.
-PowerShell: For Windows-based automation tasks.
-Splunk: For log analysis and monitoring.
-Elastic Stack (ELK): For centralized logging and analysis.
-Phantom: For security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR).
-ServiceNow: For incident management and ticketing.
-VirusTotal: For threat intelligence and file analysis.
-Cisco Threat Response: For threat intelligence and investigation.
